## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**objectives** | [**list[DestinyQuestsDestinyObjectiveProgress]**](DestinyQuestsDestinyObjectiveProgress.md) | If the item has a hard association with objectives, your progress on them will be defined here.   Objectives are our standard way to describe a series of tasks that have to be completed for a reward. | [optional] 
**flavor_objective** | **object** | I may regret naming it this way - but this represents when an item has an objective that doesn&#39;t serve a beneficial purpose, but rather is used for \&quot;flavor\&quot; or additional information. For instance, when Emblems track specific stats, those stats are represented as Objectives on the item. | [optional]
